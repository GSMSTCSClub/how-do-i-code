## Beginners

These are resources for beginners: people who have never programmed at all and want to learn how to program.

## Introductory Resources

These are resources for people who know how to program but want to learn more about a new topic or language.

### I want to learn about AI.

- [TensorFlow tutorials](https://www.tensorflow.org/overview): A tutorial over TensorFlow, a commonly used AI library for Python.

TODO

### I want to learn about Cybersecurity.

- [The Joy of Cryptography](https://joyofcryptography.com): A free undergraduate-level textbook that introduces students to the fundamentals of provable security.

TODO

### I want to learn language \[X\].

For language-agnostic resources:

- [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/): Basic introduction to a language's features and what new quirks you have to learn

For language-specific resources:

|Language|What is it?|Resources|Learning Difficulty
|-|-|-|-|
|Python|Language that is known for its simpler syntax (compared to languages like Java). It's often used to develop AI or to analyze data.|- [Python Tutorial Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html)<br>- [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)|Easy|
|TypeScript|A language which extends JavaScript's syntax to support static typing similar to what you would see in Java or C#|- [TypeScript Docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)|Medium?|
|Kotlin|A modern language aimed to be a drop-in replacement for Java. Used in Android app development.|- [Kotlin Language Docs](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/getting-started.html)|Medium|
|Swift|The language used for iOS/macOS app development.|- [Swift Learn Book](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/)|Medium?
|Rust|A performant programming language (comparable to C++) that aims to improve on C/C++ by integrating memory safety and zero-cost abstractions into the language's design. Many big tech companies are starting to transition to Rust for its memory safety.|- [Rust Learn Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/)<br>- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html)|Hard|
|Haskell|A purely functional programming language, with an **entirely different coding style** from what you would typically see in more well known languages.|- [Learn you a Haskell for a Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters)|Hard|

TODO: Java, C#, JavaScript

## Classroom

These are resources to review over content in classroom CS classes (e.g., APCSP and APCSA).

### AP CSP review

Khan Academy provides the entire AP CSP curriculum! The course can be found [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/ap-computer-science-principles).

### AP CSA review

TODO

## Practice

These are resources to practice programming skills. Although they're *practice*, but you can learn a lot from just practicing!

### I want some basic problems to practice my programming skills.

1. [CodeAbbey](http://www.codeabbey.com)

TODO add more

### I want to work on a project to hone my programming skills.

Here are some repositories that provide lists of interesting (& practical) projects you can work on to improve your skills!

1. [Project Based Learning](https://github.com/practical-tutorials/project-based-learning)
2. [Mega Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects)

## Boredom

These are resources that you can read when you're bored! Some of these are funny, amazingly clever, or just... awful. Enjoyment of these resources is of course very subjective.

|Resource|Description|Audience|Length
|-|-|-|-|
|[Obfuscating "Hello World!"](https://benkurtovic.com/2014/06/01/obfuscating-hello-world.html)|An analysis of how these 42 lines of Python code print "Hello World!" without using strings or numerals|Python programmers|Medium|
|[JavaScript Garden](http://shamansir.github.io/JavaScript-Garden/)|A trip down the many weird gotchas that JavaScript has. <br>Related: [the Wat talk](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)|JS programmers|Very long|
|[How to Write Unmaintainable Code](https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code)|A repository of terrible coding practices.|Anyone|Very long|
|[r/Programming](https://old.reddit.com/r/programming/)|This subreddit has some interesting blog posts into some interesting CS topics sometimes!|Anyone|n/a|
